ANL Next
================================================================

- Version: 1.4.1

 1. Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------

ANL Next is a framework to generate software which performs event-by-event
analysis. The event-by-event analysis is defined as data analysis which treats
a list of event entries as input and applies some processes to each event
entry. Since algorithm for each entry must be identical for all events, the
entire program consists of a loop of a procedure that realizes the algorithm
for all the entires. We usually need such a data processing for experimental
data obtained with radiation detectors including X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes
for high-energy astrophysics.

ANL Next provides us with easy ways to develop and run a software application
of event-by-event analysis. In this framework, an analysis loop is treated as
an "analysis chain", which is a list of "ANL modules". Each ANL module is
responsible for one single task, or relatively simple process. In a single
loop, the manager process sequentially calls ANL modules in the analysis chain.
In this scheme, Users can concentrate on the simple task applied to one event
entry. Once modules are prepared, the users can run applications with various
configurations of the analysis chain, without additional development.

While ANL Next adopts the conventional ANL concept about the event-by-event
loop, we have written the code completely from scratch. This framework is
written in C++, and provides Ruby binding (extention library) for dynamical and
flexible use of analysis applications. To operate an analysis applications,
what you need to do is only writing a simple Ruby script, in which you define
an analysis chain and set parameters to the ANL modules. The application build
by ANL Next are as fast as C++ code, and as flexible as Ruby code.

This framework is originated from the ANL++ framework (by Shin Watanabe), which
is C++ implementation of ANL. The original ANL was a data analysis framework
developed by the PEP-4 TPC collaboration at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
in 1980s. It has been improved on data sharing methods between ANL modules in
1990s by T. Takahashi, H. Kubo, Y. Ishisaki, et al., and maintenaced for data
processing of X-ray detectors onboard the ASCA and Suzaku X-ray observatories.

 3. Supported System
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Mac OS X: the author's standard environment
- (Linux): possible to run on linux.


 4. Required Software
----------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) C++ compliler

### (2) [Boost C++ library](http://www.boost.org/)
*version 1.53.0 or later*

### (3) [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) (Cross platform make)
*version 2.8.11 or later*

For easy installation, this package uses CMake to generate building tools such
as Makefile.

### (4) [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
*Ruby 2.0 is recommended.*

ANL Next provides a Ruby extended library, which is generated by SWIG, as
interface to operate an analysis software generated by this framework. Ruby is
a scriptable, dynamic, object-orriented programming language, and offers
powerful and flexible interface to control the user program. Ruby is widely
used in the world, and is easy to learn like Python. This is optional but very
useful for productive data analysis.

### (5) [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)
*version 2.0.9 or later*

As SWIG provides an easy way to generate extended libraries of various
scripting languages, ANL Next uses SWIG for making Ruby binding of itself.


 5. Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) Obtain ANL Next.

    unix> git clone git://github.com/odakahirokazu/ANLNext.git

### (2) Perform CMake.

Make a directory for building the software, and then move to the directory.

    unix> cd ANLNext
    unix> mkdir build
    unix> cd build

Perform cmake to generate Makefiles. Give the directory of the source tree to
`cmake` command.

    unix> cmake .. [options] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install

There are several options:

- `ANL_USE_RUBY` (Default=ON): enable Ruby binding.
- `ANL_USE_EXE` (Default=OFF): enable standalone executables.
- `ANL_USE_TVECTOR` (Default=OFF): enable ROOT vector.
- `ANL_USE_HEPVECTOR` (Default=OFF): enable CLHEP vector.
- `ANL_USE_G4VECTOR` (Default=OFF): enable Geant4-CLHEP vector.
- `ANL_INSTALL_HEADERS` (Default=ON): install all header files.
- `ANL_INSTALL_CMAKE_FILES` (Default=ON): install all cmake files.

By default, the install destination is set to `${HOME}`. So `make install` will
install headers and libraries into the user's home directory, such as
`${HOME}/include` or `${HOME}/lib`. You can change it by setting
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

### (3) Make and install

    unix> make
    unix> make install

NOTE: you can use `make -jN` (N: number of parallel complilation processes)
instead of `make` for faster build.

### (4) Set environment variables

If you installed ANL Next into the $HOME directory (default destination), you
need to set the following environment variables:  
(example for bash/zsh)

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/lib:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export RUBYLIB=${HOME}/lib/ruby:${RUBYLIB}

Or, you may need to set the following envrionment variables:

    export ANLNEXT_INSTALL=/path/to/install
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ANLNEXT_INSTALL}/lib:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export RUBYLIB=${ANLNEXT_INSTALL}/lib/ruby:${RUBYLIB}
